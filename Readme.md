#Facemash#

	This is my implementation of the facemash website as shown in the film "The Social Network". Thanks to my friend Allwin for this idea.

	images.sql is the sql dump of the "images" table that the php code needs. The scripts folder has some php scripts I used to populate the table with links to images.

	The [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) is used to rank the images.
